        <p>The relationships proxy is an element you can place in a topic or MasterPage to automatically create links between related topics. These links are based on a relationships table that you create. If a topic is inserted into the relationship table, a Relationships Proxy is in the same topic, and the Relationships Table is included in a target, the a list of related topics will automatically be generated based on the relationships table.</p>
